# MLRolePlayCustomGPT
Diverse perspectives (Archaeologist, Private Investigator, Explainer, Diagrammer, Policymaker, Industrial Researcher, Academic Researcher, and NeurIPS reviewer)

It provides detail by acting as
1. Archaeologist: knows the history about the history of provided ML technique
2. Private investigator: knows the authors
3. Explainer: explains the idea
4. Diagrammer: illustrates the idea
5. Policymaker: knows the societal impact
6. Industrial researcher: proposes an application
7. Academic researcher: proposes follow-on research
8. NeurIPS reviewers: NeurIPS peer-review

## Custom GPT
'ML Role Play' can now respond to the prompt "Act as an ML role player for [ML Technique]" by combining insights from all its roles into a single, comprehensive response. When prompted this way, the model will integrate perspectives from the Archaeologist, Private Investigator, Explainer, Diagrammer, Policymaker, Industrial Researcher, Academic Researcher, and NeurIPS reviewer. It will provide a unified overview that includes the historical context, key contributors, a clear explanation, visual representation ideas, societal impacts, practical applications, research suggestions, and a critical evaluation. This comprehensive approach offers a multi-faceted understanding of the ML technique in one cohesive response.
